# Nighttime Alleyway

A procedurally generated dark scary alleyway written in GLSL. This project explores procedural scene rendering and lighting effects in ShaderToy.

## Files
- baseplate.glsl – The base project has a few basic primitives and is a result of my playing around with lighting after a bunch of youtube tutorials.
- alley.glsl – The final result after extensive work, featuring a full nighttime alleyway scene with walls, ground, and sky effects.

## Usage
1. Open ShaderToy (https://www.shadertoy.com/).
2. Create a new shader.
3. Copy the code from alley.glsl or baseplate.glsl into the editor.
4. Run to see the scene rendered in real time.
